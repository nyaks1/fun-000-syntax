# Assessment 000 - Python Fundamentals & Problem Solving

- Modify `fundamentals.py` to solve the problem as stated in [TODO ref to content's problem description].
- The skeleton code needs to be fixed before the tests run.
- You can test technical correctness by running the unit tests shown below.
- DO NOT MODIFY TESTS IN THIS FILE `test_fundamentals.py`.

## To Test

- To run all the unittests on your terminal: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_fundamentals.py`
- To run a specific step's unittest on your terminal, e.g step 1: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_functions.TestFunctions.test_get_date_of_birth`
- Note: at the minimum, these (unedited) tests must succeed before you may submit the solution for review.
